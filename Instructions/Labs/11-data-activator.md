# Use Data Activator in Fabric

In Microsoft Fabric, a data warehouse provides a relational database for large-scale analytics. Unlike the default read-only SQL endpoint for tables defined in a lakehouse, a data warehouse provides full SQL semantics; including the ability to insert, update, and delete data in the tables.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: You'll need a Microsoft Fabric license to complete this exercise. See [Getting started with Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) for details of how to enable a free Fabric trial license. You will need a Microsoft *school* or *work* account to do this. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a trial of Microsoft Office 365 E3 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans).

## Create a workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, create a workspace with the Fabric trial enabled.

1. Sign into [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com) at `https://app.fabric.microsoft.com` and select **Power BI**.
2. In the menu bar on the left, select **Workspaces** (the icon looks similar to &#128455;).
3. Create a new workspace with a name of your choice, selecting a licensing mode that includes Fabric capacity (*Trial*, *Premium*, or *Fabric*).
4. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty, as shown here:
